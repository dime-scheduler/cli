The .NET tool currently supports the following verbs:

| Verb                    |
| ----------------------- |
| addCategory             |
| addPin                  |
| addTimeMarker           |
| addLiveResourceLocation |

To see the parameters, simply run the `dimescheduler` + `verb` + `--help` command and you'll get all the information you need:
